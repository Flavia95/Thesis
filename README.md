- Simulation sequences (MS) to VCF and calculate Allele Frequencies and Fst on VCF for look if simulations works well. 
[ms2vcf.py](ms2vcf.py) 

- Simulation sequences (MS) to GFA [MstoGfa.py](Thesis/MstoGfa.py)

- With Seqgene I reconstruct ancestral sequence, because I have need 'links' between bubble.

- SeqGene to GFA.[SeqgenToGfa.py](Thesis/SeqgenToGfa.py)

-Metadata for info to individuals of pop1 and pop2 [Metadata.py](Thesis/Metadata.py)

- GFA to Allele Frequencies.
Aploid [GfatoAFMetadataAploid.py](Thesis/GfatoAFMetadataAploid.py)
Diploide [GfatoAFMetadata.diploid.py](Thesis/GfatoAFMetadata.diploid.py)

- GFA to Fst
