- Simulation sequences (MS) to VCF and calculate Allele Frequencies and Fst on VCF for look if simulations works well.

- Simulation sequences (MS) to GFA. 

- With Seqgene I reconstruct ancestral sequence, because I have need links that not are bubble.

- SeqGene to GFA.

- From GFA to Allele Frequencies.
